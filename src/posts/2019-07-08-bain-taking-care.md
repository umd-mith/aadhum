_I can’t breathe_. At once: the wheezing out of a severely singular experience. Yet and also: a hailing of the social, political, economic, and environmental phenomena surrounding Eric Garner’s loss of breath.

My dissertation, _On Black Breath: A Theory and Praxis_, undertakes a partial genealogy of breath as it has been racialized within the project of modernity. I argue that Eric Garner’s “I can’t breathe,” sits amongst the larger and longer singularity of _Black breath_ being circumscribed and suffocated, while concomitantly highlighting the struggle to resist and exist within this project. I offer up the term Black breath as a lexicon through which we can thread together new histories, theories, and philosophies of the biopolitical project of modernity in order to expand the critical grammars of the contemporary moment. Vulnerability to loss of breath has been a formative figure in the Black performative, literary, and lived tradition, one that provides if not a praxis of liberation, then a kind of radical sociality, a kind of quantum entanglement.

The struggle I have found over and again while tarrying with breath and breathing is how to represent and practice something that is simultaneously material and ephemeral. In many ways this same question is one that performance studies scholars struggle with in their work. However, the concern for me has always been that breathing and breath are far more ubiquitous, yet also far more at risk of disappearing entirely for specific communities.
