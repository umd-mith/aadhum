As an educator, scholar, journalist and filmmaker, my work has sat at the intersection of black digital humanities and creative scholarship for the last decade. A TV nerd, I spent the first half of my career examining the representation of black women in television. I was consumed by depictions of black women on the small screen and how those images impacted the lives of viewers.

One of my favorite shows, _A Different World_, has a second season episode that explores the anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa. Titled “[A World Alike](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0560112/),” the episode aired on February 15, 1990, four days after liberation icon, Nelson Mandela was released from Robben Island prison. As a photojournalist for _Ebony Magazine_, my father was in the crowd that historic day; at 10 years old I vividly understood the importance of not only Mandela’s release from 27 years of bondage, but also of _A Different World_’s depiction of black diasporic solidarity with the boycotts, divestment, sanctions, and non-violent protests against Apartheid.

A July 2018 humanitarian trip to Palestine, left me inspired by the region’s anti-Apartheid and occupation liberation movement and comparisons to similar struggles plaguing South Africa and Namibia—specifically, by the current land rights’ reform and water restrictions plaguing all three countries. As I draw comparisons that link these oppressive regimes to their military, economic and political support by the U.S. government, I’m outraged and empowered. Being a 2019 [AADHum Scholar](https://aadhum.umd.edu/scholars/) gave me time to both process my experiences in all three regions and to outline my current research project.

***Agricultural Apartheid: Land & Water Reform*** is my multimedia research endeavor examining the origins and operation of systems of Apartheid, contextualizing international freedom struggles with the black liberation movement in America and the U.S. government’s support of the colonial apartheid regimes from 1948 to present day. The project explores the systems of institutionalized racial segregation, terror, political disenfranchisement and economic exclusion ruling Namibia (1948-1990), South Africa (1948-1994), and Palestine (1948-present day). It also highlights several types of local, national and international solidarity campaigns including (e.g. boycotts, divestment and sanction policies). I am particularly interested in illuminating the relationships between majority liberation movements and minority colonization and occupation powers.
